# Node Lifechecker

A node project that allows users to sign up for checking if a website is down or up.
This API also allows users to get notified if the status of the website changes.

This project is made with node and does not use npm oder any dependencies.

For this purpose the file system is used as a key-value store (database), but i will update this project to connect with a database without using any node modules
